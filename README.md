# Flex10 Protect

This is a simple game voicing our minor frustration with certain individuals in a certain happening that took place a few motnhs ago.

Your goal is protect the delivery of as many of ~~Les Halles~~ Munkler's posts as possible to the Gunn students on Lernejologio. However, the Great Grand Google Translator of Arabic is obstructing the delivery with his own creations. In addition, his sidekicks ~~PG~~ Paffy and ~~Low~~ Poof are backing him by attacking you with diacritics. The FLEX10 Lernejologio course must remain undetected by the Gunn administration as it is one of the few media for student voice left, but it is being threatened by Gunn students tired of the spam by the Great Grand Google Translator of Arabic.
